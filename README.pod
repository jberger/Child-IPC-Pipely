=head1 NAME

Child-IPC-Pipely - use Child with IO::Pipely for more portable IPC

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Child;
 my $child = Child->new( sub { ... }, pipely => 1 );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<Child> is a great way to manage forking, but its default IPC uses C<pipe> which sadly isn't as portable as it could be in places.
L<IO::Pipely> provides a better solution (and indeed describes the problem better than I can).
